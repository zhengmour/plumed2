\page master-ISDD-1 Master ISDD tutorial 2023: Brief introduction to PLUMED

\section master-ISDD-1-aims Aim

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce users to the PLUMED syntax. We will go through the preparation of input files to calculate
and print simple collective variables on a pre-calculated trajectory. This tutorial has been prepared by Max Bonomi 
(adapting a lot of material from other tutorials and Masterclass) for 
the <a href="http://isddteach.sdv.univ-paris-diderot.fr/fr/accueil.html">Master In Silico Drug Design</a>, held
at Université Paris Cité on March 6th, 2023.

\section master-ISDD-1-lo Objectives 

Once this tutorial is completed, users will be able to:

- Write a simple PLUMED input file and use it with the PLUMED \ref driver to analyze a trajectory.
- Print collective variables such as distances (\ref DISTANCE), torsional angles (\ref TORSION), and gyration radius (\ref GYRATION) using the \ref PRINT action.
- Use \ref MOLINFO shortcuts.

\section master-ISDD-1-software Software

In this and in the next tutorial, we will use two pieces of software: <a href="https://www.plumed.org">PLUMED</a> version 2.8.2 and
<a href="http://www.gromacs.org">GROMACS</a> version 2019.6. First, we need to install the software on your machine using `conda`.

\subsection master-ISDD-1-install Installation

First, check if `conda` is installed on your machine by typing:

\verbatim
conda
\endverbatim

In case the command is not found, please follow the instructions below to install `conda` in the
directory `/path/to/conda`. You can choose it in your home so that you will have write permission to it.
If `conda` is already installed on your machine, please skip the instructions below and move directly
to the creation of the `conda` environment for this tutorial.

\verbatim
# on Linux:
wget -c https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
# on MacOS:
# wget -c https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
bash ./miniconda.sh -b -f -p /path/to/conda
# export PATH to find the conda executable
export PATH="/path/to/conda/bin:$PATH"
# initialize bash shell
conda init bash
\endverbatim

Now we can create a `conda` environment for the ISDD tutorial using the following commands:

\verbatim
# create environment
conda create --name ISDD-tutorial-2023
\endverbatim

and activate it with:

\verbatim
# activate environment
conda activate ISDD-tutorial-2023
\endverbatim

Finally, we can proceed with the installation of the required software: 

\verbatim
conda install -c conda-forge plumed
conda install --strict-channel-priority -c plumed/label/masterclass -c conda-forge gromacs
\endverbatim

The `--strict-channel-priority` might be necessary in case your `conda` install is configured to download packages from the `bioconda` channel. Indeed, `bioconda` contains a version of GROMACS that is **not** patched with PLUMED and would thus not work here.

Keep in mind that every time you open a new shell, in order to use PLUMED and GROMACS you need to 
activate the `ISDD-tutorial-2023` environment using the following command:

\verbatim
conda activate ISDD-tutorial-2023
\endverbatim

\subsection master-ISDD-1-plumed PLUMED overview
 
PLUMED is a library that can be incorporated into many MD codes by adding a relatively simple and well documented interface.
Once it is incorporated you can use PLUMED to perform a variety of different analyses on-the-fly and to bias 
the sampling in MD simulations. Additionally, PLUMED can be used as a standalone code for analyzing trajectories.
If you are using the code in this way you can run the PLUMED executable by issuing the command:

\verbatim
plumed <instructions>
\endverbatim

Let's start by getting a feel for the range of calculations that PLUMED can do. Issue the following command now:

\verbatim
plumed --help 
\endverbatim

The output of this command is a list of tasks that PLUMED can perform. Among these, there are commands that allow you
to patch an MD code, postprocess metadynamics simulations, and build the manual. In this
tutorial we will mostly use PLUMED to analyze trajectories. In order to do so, we will
learn how to use the \ref driver tool. 
Let's look at the options of PLUMED \ref driver by issuing the following command:  

\verbatim
plumed driver --help
\endverbatim

As you can see we can do a number of things with PLUMED \ref driver. For all of these options, however, we are going to need to write 
a PLUMED input file. The syntax of the PLUMED input file is the same that we will use later to run enhanced sampling simulations during
a MD simulation, so all the things that you will learn now will be useful later when you will run PLUMED coupled to GROMACS.

\subsection master-ISDD-1-gromacs GROMACS overview

GROMACS is a molecular dynamics package mainly designed for simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.
More info can be found <a href="http://www.gromacs.org">here</a>.

You can check that GROMACS is properly working by typing:

\verbatim
gmx mdrun -h
\endverbatim

If you inspect the long output generated by this command, you will notice a `-plumed` option, which indicates that GROMACS has
properly been compiled with PLUMED. Great, now you are ready to go!

\section master-ISDD-1-structure Your first PLUMED input file

The main goal of PLUMED is to compute collective variables (or CVs), which are complex descriptors 
of the system that can be used to describe the conformational change of a protein or a chemical reaction.
This can be done either on-the-fly during a molecular dynamics simulations or _a posteriori_ on a 
pre-calculated trajectory using PLUMED as a post-processing tool. 
In both cases one, you should create an input file with a specific PLUMED syntax. 
Have a look at the sample input file below:

\plumedfile
# Compute distance between atoms 1 and 10.
# Atoms are ordered as in the trajectory files and their numbering starts from 1.
# The distance is called "d" for future reference.
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10

# Compute the torsional angle between atoms 1, 10, 20, and 30.
# The angle is called "phi1" for future reference.
phi1: TORSION ATOMS=1,10,20,30

# The same CV defined above can be split into multiple lines
# The angle is called "phi2" for future reference.
TORSION ...
LABEL=phi2
ATOMS=1,10,20,30
...

# Print "d" on a file named "COLVAR1" every 10 steps.
PRINT ARG=d FILE=COLVAR1 STRIDE=10

# Print "phi1" and "phi2" on another file named "COLVAR2" every 100 steps.
PRINT ARG=phi1,phi2 FILE=COLVAR2 STRIDE=100
\endplumedfile

In the input file above, each line defines a so-called action. In this simple example, 
actions are used to compute a distance, a dihedral angle, 
or print some values on a file. Each action supports a number of keywords,
whose value is specified. Action names are highlighted in green and, by clicking on them, you can go to the
corresponding page in the manual that contains a detailed description of each keyword.
Actions that support the keyword `STRIDE` are those that determine how frequently things are done.
Notice that the default value for `STRIDE` is always 1. In the example above, omitting `STRIDE` keywords
the corresponding `COLVAR` files would have been written for every frame of the analyzed trajectory.
All the other actions in the example above, i.e. \ref DISTANCE and \ref TORSION, do not 
support the `STRIDE` keyword and are only calculated when requested. That is, `d` will be computed
every 10 frames, and `phi1` and `phi2` every 100 frames.

Variables should be given a name (in the example above, `d`, `phi1`, and `phi2`), which is
then used to refer to these variables in subsequent actions, such as the \ref PRINT command.
A lists of atoms should be provided as comma separated numbers, with no space.

You can find more information on the PLUMED syntax
at \ref Syntax page of the manual. The complete documentation for all the supported
collective variables can be found at the \ref colvarintro page.

\subsection master-ISDD-1-units The PLUMED internal units

By default the PLUMED inputs and outputs quantities in the following units:

- Length: nanometers
- Energy: kJ/mol
- Time: picoseconds
- Mass: amu
- Charge: e

If you want to change these units, you can do this using the \ref UNITS keyword. 


\section master-ISDD-1-resources Resources

The \htmlonly<span style="background-color:yellow">\endhtmlonly<a href="https://github.com/maxbonomi/plumed-nest-data/raw/master/projects-2020/master-ISDD-1.tar.gz" style="font-weight:bold" style="color:green" download="https://github.com/maxbonomi/plumed-nest-data/raw/master/projects-2020/master-ISDD-1.tar.gz">TARBALL</a>\htmlonly</span>\endhtmlonly for this tutorial contains the following files:
- `GB1_native.pdb`: a PDB file with the native structure of the GB1 protein.
- `traj-whole.xtc`: a trajectory in `xtc` format. GB1 has already been made whole by fixing discontinuities due to periodic boundary conditions.
- `traj-broken.xtc`: the same trajectory as it was originally produced by GROMACS. Here GB1 is broken by periodic boundary conditions.

After dowloading the compressed archive to your local machine, you can unpack it using the following command:

\verbatim
tar xvzf master-ISDD-1.tar.gz 
\endverbatim

Once unpacked, all the files can be found in the `master-ISDD-1` directory. To keep things clean, 
it is recommended to run each exercise in a separate sub-directory that you can create inside `master-ISDD-1`.

\note This tutorial has been tested with PLUMED version 2.8.2.

\section master-ISDD-1-ex Exercises

\subsection master-ISDD-1-ex-1 Exercise 1: Computing and printing simple collective variables

In this exercise, we will learn how to compute and print collective variables on a pre-calculated MD trajectory.
To analyze the trajectories provided here, we will:
- create a PLUMED input file with a text editor (typically called `plumed.dat`);
- run the PLUMED \ref driver utility.

Notice that you can also visualize trajectories with `VMD` (always a good idea!).
For example, the trajectory `traj-whole.xtc` can be visualized with the command:

\verbatim
vmd GB1_native.pdb traj-whole.xtc
\endverbatim

Let's now prepare a PLUMED input file to calculate: 
- the gyration radius of all CA protein atoms (\ref GYRATION). Look in the `GB1_native.pdb` file
  to retrieve the list of indexes of the CA atoms;
- the total number of contacts (\ref COORDINATION) between all protein CA atoms.
  For \ref COORDINATION, set reference distance `R_0` to 8.0 Angstrom (be careful with units!).

Below you can find a sample `plumed.dat` file that you can use as a template.
Whenever you see an highlighted \highlight{FILL} string, be careful because this is a string that you must replace.

\plumedfile
# Compute gyration radius on CA atoms:
r: GYRATION ATOMS=__FILL__

# Compute number of contacts between CA atoms
co: COORDINATION GROUPA=__FILL__ R_0=__FILL__

# Print the two collective variables on COLVAR file every step
PRINT ARG=__FILL__ FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=__FILL__
\endplumedfile

Once your `plumed.dat` file is complete, you can run the PLUMED \ref driver as follows:

\verbatim
> plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --mf_xtc traj-broken.xtc
\endverbatim

Scroll in your terminal to read the PLUMED log. As you can see,
PLUMED gives a lot of feedback about the input that it is reading and the actions that it will
execute. Please take your time to inspect the log file and check if PLUMED is actually doing what you intend to do.

The command above will create a `COLVAR` file like this one:

\verbatim
#! FIELDS time r co
 0.000000 2.458704 165.184127
 1.000000 2.341932 164.546604
 2.000000 2.404708 162.606975
 3.000000 2.454297 143.850122
 4.000000 2.569342 147.110408
 5.000000 2.304027 163.608703
\endverbatim

Notice that the first line informs you about the content of each column.

__In case you obtain different numbers, check your input, you might have made some mistake!__

This file can then be visualized using `gnuplot` (for more info about this tool, look <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">here</a>):

\verbatim
gnuplot> p "COLVAR" u 1:2, "" u 1:3
\endverbatim

Now, look at what happens if you run the exercise twice. The second time, PLUMED
will *back up* the previously produced file so as not to overwrite it.
You can also *concatenate* your files by using the action \ref RESTART at the beginning
of your input file.

Finally, let's try to use the same input file with `traj-whole.xtc` and examine the results.
Did you find the same results as with the previous trajectory? Why?

\subsection master-ISDD-1-ex-2 Exercise 2:  MOLINFO shortcuts

PLUMED provides some shortcuts to select atoms with specific properties.
To use this feature, you should specify the \ref MOLINFO action along with a reference
PDB file. This command is used to provide information on the molecules that are present in your system.

Let's try to use this functionality to calculate the backbone dihedral angle \f$ \phi \f$ (phi) of residue 2
of the GB1 protein. This CV is defined by the action \ref TORSION and a set of 4 atoms. For residue `i`,
the dihedral \f$ \phi \f$ is defined by these atoms: C(i-1),N(i),CA(i),C(i) (see Fig. \ref master-ISDD-1-dih-fig).

\anchor master-ISDD-1-dih-fig
\image html master-ISDD-1-dih-fig.png "Definition of backbone dihedral angles."

After consulting the manual and inspecting `GB1_native.pdb`, let's define the dihedral angle \f$ \phi \f$ of residue 2 
in two different ways:
1. specifying an explicit list of 4 atoms (`t1`).
2. using the \ref MOLINFO shortcut (`t2`);

\plumedfile
# Activate MOLINFO functionalities
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=__FILL__

# Define the dihedral phi of residue 2 as an explicit list of 4 atoms
t1: TORSION ATOMS=__FILL__
# Define the same dihedral using MOLINFO shortcuts
t2: TORSION ATOMS=__FILL__

# Print the two collective variables on COLVAR file every 10 steps
PRINT ARG=__FILL__ FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=__FILL__
\endplumedfile

After completing the PLUMED input file above, let's use it to analyze the trajectory `traj-whole.xtc` using the \ref driver tool:

\verbatim
> plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --mf_xtc traj-whole.xtc
\endverbatim

You can use `gnuplot` to visualize the trajectory of the two CVs calculated with the PLUMED input file above
and written in the `COLVAR` file.
__Are the two trajectories identical?__

\section master-ISDD-1-conclusions Conclusions

In summary, in this tutorial you should have learned how to use PLUMED to:
- Analyze previously calculated trajectories using the \ref driver utility.
- Define \ref MOLINFO shortcuts.
